# HeapSort

Here is the Go implementation of the **Heap Sort** algorithm along with a visualization of the sorting process.

## Heap Sort Algorithm

Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds a binary heap from the input array, repeatedly extracts the maximum (or minimum) element, and places it in its correct position in the sorted array. It involves two main steps: first, building a max-heap (or min-heap), and second, continuously removing the largest (or smallest) element and re-heapifying the remaining elements.

## Visualization

For a visual explanation of heap sort, check out this video: [Heap Sort Visualization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgUiY8CVDhU&ab_channel=AbhilasBiswas)

The video demonstrates the heap sort process, showing how elements are organized into a heap structure and sorted by repeatedly extracting the maximum (or minimum) element.
