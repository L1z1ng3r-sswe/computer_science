# SelectionSort

Here is the Go and C++ implementation of the **Selection sort** algorithm along with a step-by-step explanation of how the sorting process works.

## Selection Sort Algorithm

Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that divides the input array into two parts: the sorted part and the unsorted part. The algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted part and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted part, thereby growing the sorted portion of the array.

### Time Complexity

Selection sort has a time complexity of **O(nÂ²)** due to the nested loops, where `n` is the number of elements in the array. As a result, this algorithm is inefficient for large datasets.
